This small project is an example to show how we can set up a basic server-side rendered project using Webpack. 


- Server-side rendering from scratch, no dependency on Next.js or Remix
- Development server complete with server-side rendering and client-side hot module reloading with React Fast Refresh

### Setup

```sh
# initialize
$ npm install

# development
$ npm run dev
```
